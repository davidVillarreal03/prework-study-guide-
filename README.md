# Prework Study Guide Webpage 

## Description

My motivation was to improve my understanding of what the process is like to work on a coding project and all the steps that are required to make it succesful. This project was built to help put my notes into a website so I can have a reference in case I need help understanding a certain topic. It will help me solve a problem I run into if I forget the process of putting together a full stack project. I learned that coding is a very challenging but rewarding field to enter, it gives me an idea of how a project process will be in the future of the bootcamp.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
